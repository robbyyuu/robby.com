<p>以下内容摘自<a href="https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/timeseriesbook/frequency-and-time-scale-analysis.html">A Very Short Course on Time Series Analysis</a>.</p>
<div id="idea" class="section level2">
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>Critical to the idea of time scale analysis is <em>Parseval’s theorem</em> which says, roughly, that the total variation in a time series is equal to the sum of the variation across all time scales.</p>
<p>It might be more useful to not think of this as a model, but rather as a transformation of the data from <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> observed data points into a series of <em>correlations</em> (<span class="math inline">\(a_p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_p\)</span>) with respect to sines and cosines of different frequencies.</p>
<p>Standard regression modeling theory tells us that the estimates of the <span class="math inline">\(a_{p}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b_{p}\)</span> coefficients in the model
are</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\hat{a}_{0} &amp;=\bar{y} \\
\hat{a}_{p} &amp;=\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left(y_{t}-\bar{y}\right) \cos (2 \pi t p / n)}{\sum_{t=1}^{n} \cos (2 \pi t p / n)^{2}} \\
&amp;=\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n}\left(y_{t}-\bar{y}\right) \cos (2 \pi t p / n)}{n / 2} \\
&amp;=\frac{2}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n}\left(y_{t}-\bar{y}\right) \cos (2 \pi t p / n) \\
&amp;=\frac{2}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} y_{t} \cos (2 \pi t p / n) \\
\hat{b}_{p} &amp;=\frac{2}{n} \sum_{t=1}^{n} y_{t} \sin (2 \pi t p / n).
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Each of the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{a}_{p} \mathrm{~s}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{b}_{p} \mathrm{~s}\)</span> are proportional to the covariance between the data <span class="math inline">\(y_{t}\)</span> and sines and cosines containing <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> cycles per <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> data points. We will note that the <span class="math inline">\(\hat{a}_{p} \mathrm{~s}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\hat{a}_{p} \mathrm{~s}\)</span> are also proportional to the
Fourier transform coefficients associated with frequency <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, although they are generally not computed in
this manner.</p>
<p>对数据关于不同频率的sin和cos做回归, 得到系数(不同系数对比刻画了数据与不同频率sin及cos的相关性强弱), 从上述推导中可以看出回归系数就是相应的傅里叶系数.</p>

<div id="partitioning-the-variation" class="section level2">
<h2>Partitioning the Variation</h2>
<p>We can take an analysis of variance approach to the main model for <span class="math inline">\(y_{t}\)</span> above and decompose the total
variation in <span class="math inline">\(y_{t}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{t}\left(y_{t}-\bar{y}\right)^{2}\)</span> into a residual sum of squares and the variation attributable to the various
frequencies.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{t=0}^{n-1}\left(y_{t}-\bar{y}\right)^{2} &amp;=\sum_{t=0}^{n-1}\left[\sum_{p=1}^{n / 2} a_{p} \cos (2 \pi p t / n)+b_{p} \sin (2 \pi p t / n)\right]^{2} \\
&amp;=\sum_{t=0}^{n-1} \sum_{p=1}^{n / 2}\left(a_{p} \cos (2 \pi p t / n)+b_{p} \sin (2 \pi p t / n)\right)^{2}
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>从方差分解的角度看时间序列的谱的含义, 对上式<em>交换求和顺序</em>(注意sin及cos的正交性在恒等变换中的作用),</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
\sum_{t=0}^{n-1}\left(y_{t}-\bar{y}\right)^{2}=\sum_{p=1}^{n / 2-1} \frac{n}{2}\left(a_{p}^{2}+b_{p}^{2}\right)+n a_{n / 2}^{2}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(p \neq n / 2\)</span> we can write <span class="math inline">\(R_{p}^{2}=a_{p}^{2}+b_{p}^{2}\)</span>. Then, if we divide through by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> we can then write</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=0}^{n-1}\left(y_{t}-\bar{y}\right)^{2}=\sum_{p=1}^{n / 2-1} R_{p}^{2} / 2+a_{n / 2}^{2}
\end{equation}\]</span></p>
<p>If we interpret <span class="math inline">\(R_{p}^{2} / 2\)</span> is the amount of “energy” associated with variation at frequency <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, then the above equation states that the total variance of <span class="math inline">\(y_{t}\)</span> is equal to the sum of the “energies” <span class="math inline">\(R_{p}^{2} / 2\)</span> associated with each frequency of variation. This is Parseval’s theorem.</p>
</div>
<div id="periodogram" class="section level2">
<h2>Periodogram</h2>
<p>One problem with the raw periodogram is that it is not a consistent estimator of the the energy
associated with a given frequency. In other words, the variability of the estimate of <span class="math inline">\(I\left(\omega_{p}\right)\)</span> does not go to
zero as the length of the time series <span class="math inline">\(n \rightarrow \infty .\)</span> Intuitively, this is clear because as <span class="math inline">\(n \rightarrow \infty,\)</span> we may have
more data points but we also have more frequency coeffients to estimate! So the number of parameters
also increases with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Therefore, the plot of <span class="math inline">\(I\left(\omega_{p}\right)\)</span> will get denser as <span class="math inline">\(n \rightarrow \infty\)</span> becase there are more
frequencies <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{p},\)</span> but it will not become less noisy.</p>
<p>However, it turns out there is a simple way to produce a consistent estimate of <span class="math inline">\(I\left(\omega_{p}\right)\)</span>, and that is to smooth the estimate by averaging values of <span class="math inline">\(\hat{I}\left(\omega_{p}\right)\)</span> with values at neighboring frequencies.</p>
